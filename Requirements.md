# FAIR Data Principles

## 1. Findable
*Metadata and data should be easily discoverable by both humans and computers.*

- **F1. Persistent Identifiers:** Assign globally unique and persistent identifiers (e.g., DOIs) to all (meta)data.
- **F2. Rich Metadata:** Describe data comprehensively to ensure context is understood.
- **F3. Explicit Linking:** Ensure metadata clearly includes the specific identifier of the data it describes.
- **F4. Searchable Indexing:** Register or index (meta)data in a searchable resource.

## 2. Accessible
*Users need to know how to access the data, including any authentication requirements.*

- **A1. Standard Protocols:** Ensure (meta)data is retrievable by its identifier using a standardized, open communications protocol (e.g., HTTP).
- **A2. Metadata Longevity:** Metadata should remain accessible even if the actual data is no longer available (acting as a "digital tombstone").

## 3. Interoperable
*Data needs to be integrated with other data and interoperate with applications or workflows.*

- **I1. Shared Language:** Use formal, accessible, and shared languages for knowledge representation to ensure machines can read the data.
- **I2. Standard Vocabularies:** Utilize vocabularies and ontologies that themselves follow FAIR principles.
- **I3. Qualified References:** Include clear links to other related (meta)data to create meaningful connections.

## 4. Reusable
*Data should be well-described so it can be replicated and combined in different settings.*

- **R1. Relevant Attributes:** Richly describe (meta)data with a variety of accurate attributes to ensure context is clear.
    - **R1.1. Clear Licensing:** Release data with a clear and accessible usage license to clarify legal reuse rights.
    - **R1.2. Detailed Provenance:** Associate data with its history so users know its origin and processing.
    - **R1.3. Community Standards:** Ensure the data meets the standards relevant to its specific domain.
